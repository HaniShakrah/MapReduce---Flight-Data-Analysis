1.	Install Hadoop/Oozie on your AWS VMs.
2.	Design, implement, and run an Oozie workflow to find out
the 3 airlines with the highest and lowest probability, respectively, for being on schedule; the 3 airports with the longest and shortest average taxi time per flight (both in and out), respectively; and
the most common reason for flight cancellations.

Requirements:
1.	Your workflow must contain at least three MapReduce jobs that run in fully distributed mode.
2.	Run your workflow to analyze the entire data set (total 22 years from 1987 to 2008) at one time on two VMs first and then gradually increase the system scale to the maximum allowed number of VMs for at least 5 increment steps, and measure each corresponding workflow
execution time.
3.	Run your workflow to analyze the data in a progressive manner with an increment of 1 year, i.e. the first year (1987), the first 2 years (1987-1988), the first 3 years (1987-1989), â€¦, and the total 22 years (1987-2008), on the maximum allowed number of VMs, and measure each corresponding workflow execution time

 
Commands.txt ------------ text file that lists all the commands you used to run your code and produce the required results in fully distributed mode
FinalProject.java ------------The source code of your MapReduce programs (including the JAR files) and any other programs you might have developed and included in the workflow
Oozie workflow.txt ------------The Oozie workflow XML file
Report.pdf ------------A project report in PDF that includes:
        A diagram that shows the structure of your Oozie workflow
        A detailed description of the algorithm you designed to solve each of the problems
        A performance measurement plot that compares the workflow execution time in response to an increasing number of VMs used for processing the entire data set (22 years) and an in- depth discussion on the observed performance comparison results
        A performance measurement plot that compares the workflow execution time in response to an increasing data size (from 1 year to 22 years) and an in-depth discussion on the observed performance comparison results
